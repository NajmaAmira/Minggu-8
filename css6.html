        Hey, it's been years<br>
        We've been friends for so long but there's something you don't know<br>
        Something inside me that I've been keeping for quite some time now<br><br>

        I'm too afraid to say it out loud<br>
        Cause it might change the way we are<br>
        But if I keep this to myself I know that it's no good so<br><br>

        I'm just gonna wing it I'm not gonna keep it to myself<br>
        So listen up and hear me cause I'm only gonna say it once<br><br>

        I want to wake up next to you<br>
        I want to spend all my life with you and you alone<br>
        I want to be the one that you can lean on for the rest of your life<br><br>

        Side by side<br>
        Build our own little castle<br>
        Until we both grow old<br><br>

        Just like they say<br>
        Until death do us part<br><br>

        Hey, it's been years<br>
        We've walked side by side through both our ups and downs<br>
        I know you and you know me so well<br>
        We're inseparable<br><br>

        But I'm too afraid to say how I feel<br>
        Cause it might change the way are<br>
        But I've prepared myself no holding back it's now or never<br><br>

        Here we go now, now's the time, I'm really gonna say it all<br>
        So listen up and hear me cause I'm only gonna say it once<br><br>

        I want to wake up next to you<br>
        I want to spend all my life with you and you alone<br>
        I want to be the one that you can lean on for the rest of your life<br><br>

        Side by side<br>
        Build our own little castle<br>
        Until we both grow old<br><br>

        Just like they say<br>
        Until death do us part<br><br>

        Hey, it's been <br>
        We've been friends for so long but there's something you won't know<br>
        Something inside me that I've been keeping for quite some time now<br><br>

        I'm too afraid to say it out loud<br>
        And now it's all too late<br>
        I keep it all to myself and now<br><br>
        
        You chose to be with him<br>
        And I'm just your best friend<br>
        Oh I'm just a best friend<br><br>

        Now you wake up next to him<br>
        And you spend all your life with him and him alone<br>
        You chose him to be the one you can lean on for the rest of your life<br><br>

        Side by side<br>
        Build your own little castle<br>
        Until you both grow old<br><br>

        But I'll stick by your side<br>
        Just as a best friend<br>
        I'll just be your best friend<br>
        Until death do us part<br><br>

        I'll just be your best friend<br>
        Just be your best friend<br>
        Until death do us part<br><br>

        I'll just be your best friend<br>
