    <h1>
        Like I'm Gonna Lose You
    </h1>
    <p>
        I found myself dreaming<br>
        In silver and gold<br>
        Like a scene from a movie<br>
        That every broken heart knows<br>
        We were walking on moonlight<br>
        And you pulled me close<br>
        Split second and you disappeared<br>
        And then I was all alone<br><br>

        I woke up in tears<br>
        With you by my side<br>
        A breath of relief<br>
        And I realized<br>
        No, we're not promised tomorrow<br><br>

        So I'm gonna love you<br>
        Like I'm gonna lose you<br>
        I'm gonna hold you<br>
        Like I'm saying goodbye<br>
        Wherever we're standing<br>
        I won't take you for granted<br>
        'cause we'll never know when<br>
        When we'll run out of time<br>
        So I'm gonna love you<br>
        Like I'm gonna lose you<br>
        I'm gonna love you<br>
        Like I'm gonna lose you<br><br>

        In the blink of an eye<br>
        Just a whisper of smoke<br>
        You could lose everything<br>
        The truth is you never know<br><br>

        So I'll kiss you longer, baby<br>
        Any chance that I get<br>
        I'll make the most of the minutes<br>
        And love with no regrets<br><br>

        Let's take our time<br>
        To say what we want<br>
        Use what we got<br>
        Before it's all gone<br>
        'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow
    </p>
